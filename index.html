                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                The U.S. makes up 4% of the world's population yet hosts 20% of the world's prisoners (<a
                    href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/mass-incarceration" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">ACLU</a>). Despite the high rates, understanding U.S. criminal justice data is hard since data is
                decentralized, disorganized, variable. This data narrative analyzes rates of incarceration between 1970 - 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, I will define the terms prison and jail, which are often used interchangeably despite being different.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Incarceration refers to someone who is in prison or jail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prisons operate at the federal or state level and hold, while jails operate at the local level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prisons are where criminals serve their sentences of imprisonment, while jails hold unconvicted
                    people who have been arrested and are waiting for their case decision to be made; jails also hold
                    people serving shorter sentences for misdemeanor or low-level felony convictions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    About two thirds of U.S. incarcerations are at the prison level and one third at the jail level.
                </li>
            </ol>

                    including demographic information about the incarcerated.</p>
            <p> Before visualizing the data, I first cleaned the data:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>While some states had relatively complete incarceration data, others did not. 
                    I exlcuded the following states from the analysis due to incomplete data: CT, DE, HI, VT, and RI. </li>
                <li>
                    For each state that was not excluded, I summed the state's county-level incarceration in order to produce state-level incarceration rates.

                What is the correlation between jail rate and prison rate?

                The following scatterplot answers this question. The prison and jail rates are plotted for each state for the year 2016. 
                Note that only states that have prison and jail rate data available are
                displayed (17 states are excluded from this visual).

                From the scatterplot we see there is a noticeable correlation between prison population rate and jail population rate. 
                This means that if for state is known to have a high prison rate, it is likely to have a similarly high jail rate. 
                Conversely, if a state has a low jail rate, it is likely that the state has a similarly low prison rate.    
            </p>
            <p>
                The only states that have a higher jail rate than prison rate are Massachusetts and Utah. Generally states have a higher 
                prison rate than jail rate. There are even a handful of states that have a very high prison rate but low jail rate, 
                namely Arizona, Michigan, Missouri, and Ohio. These states have prison rate that are roughly 3x their jail rate! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another interesting observation is that northeastern states generally have both low prison and jail rates. We see that 
                Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey are in the bottom left corner of the scatterplot. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, it is very interesting how wide incarceration rates vary by state. For prison rates this ranged from 188 to 964, with 
                Massachusetts on the lower end and Mississippi on the higher end. For jail rates this ranged from 188 to 747, with Minnesota 
                on the lower end and Kentucky on the higher end.

        <div class="textStyling">
            <p>Upon using the slider bar, we first noticed that the map gradually darkens with time &ndash; Nationally,
                the rate of the population in jail more than doubles in about 30 years, from 0.15%&nbsp; of the
                population in 1983 to a peak at 0.38% in 2006-2009.</p>
            <p>A second noticeable pattern is that the Southern states consistently jail a higher rate of their
                population &ndash; especially the Deep South, and specifically Louisiana. In fact, each year from
                2008-2011, 1% of Louisiana&rsquo;s population was in jail at some point that year.</p
            <p>Since our dataset was missing large portions of <em>prison</em> data, the map above and our analysis only
                includes data for people in <em>jail</em>. However, the prison population can be even larger than the
                jailed population - the Prison Policy Institute <a
                    href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>
                that in 2021, out of 1.9M locked up people, over 1M were in state prisons. This means that some of our
                numbers in the report below are more even startling than they already are. The fact that some states
                jail over 1% of their people has somber implications about their overall incarceration rates.</p>
