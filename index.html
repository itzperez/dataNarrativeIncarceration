                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>The United States incarcerates 2.3 million people, one of the highest rates in the world (<a
                    href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Prison
                    Policy Initiative</a>). A common refrain is that the United States has 4% of the world's population,
                yet has 20% of the world's prisoners (<a
                    href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/mass-incarceration" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">ACLU</a>). Despite unusually high rates, using actual data to understand this system
                &ndash; the incarcerated people, judicial system, its consequences &ndash; is hard, since data is
                decentralized, disorganized, and accounted for via numerous different private and federal institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding incarceration data requires defining the terms “prison” and “jail”.
                Although these terms are commonly used interchangeably, there are notable differences:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Prisons operate at the federal or state level and hold, while jails operate at the local level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prisons are where criminals serve their sentences of imprisonment, while jails hold unconvicted
                    people who have been arrested and are waiting for their case decision to be made; jails also hold
                    people serving shorter sentences for misdemeanor or low-level felony convictions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    About two thirds of U.S. incarcerations are at the prison level and one third at the jail level.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In this project, we use the most complete incarceration dataset we've found to explore the most common
                types of
                incarceration in America &ndash; jail and prison &ndash; comparing the two, its rates across the country
                and over the last several decades.

                Data & Methods
            </h2>
            <p>Our data comes from the Vera Institute of Justice's <a
                    href="https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">Incarceration Trends Dataset</a>, which contains county and jurisdiction level data
                for jails and prisons, as well as state level prison data, intermittently between 1970-2021. Built over
                5 years from 2015 to 2020, this dataset pulls from collections in the US federal government's
                Bureau of Justice Statistics. Other than prison, jail, and geographical information, this dataset also
                contains demographic information about incarcerated populations.</p>
            <p>From there, we performed data cleaning:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We noticed that 1970-2016 had relatively complete prison and jail data, and that some states still
                    had
                    no or very incomplete data &ndash; specifically, CT, DE, HI, VT, and RI. So we narrowed down to only
                    those years for our visualizations, and, when relevant, marked CT, DE, HI, VT, and RI as &ldquo;no
                    data&rdquo; in our visualizations.</li>
                <li>After removing all data from years outside of that, we grouped our data on a state level, including
                    summing all the county population information for each year and state, and calculating rates from
                    that data.</li>
                <li>From there, we customize the dataset for the needs of each individual visualization. So we did some
                    lightweight data cleaning &ndash; for instance, for the maps visualization, we computed
                    national-level incarceration data.</li>
            </ol>

                Jail Rates vs. Prison Rates, 2016
            </h2>
            <p>
                In this section, we examine incarceration population rates. Incarceration rates represent the
                number of people in a given area per 100,000 people. For example, a rate of 500 signified that 500 out
                100,000 people in a given area are incarcerated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following scatterplot examines the correlation between jail population rate and prison population
                rate by state for the year 2016. Note that only states that have prison and jail rate data available are
                displayed (17 states are excluded from this visual).

                From the scatterplot we see there is a noticeable correlation between prison population rate and jail population rate. 
                This means that if for state is known to have a high prison rate, it is likely to have a similarly high jail rate. 
                Conversely, if a state has a low jail rate, it is likely that the state has a similarly low prison rate.    
            </p>
            <p>
                The only states that have a higher jail rate than prison rate are Massachusetts and Utah. Generally states have a higher 
                prison rate than jail rate. There are even a handful of states that have a very high prison rate but low jail rate, 
                namely Arizona, Michigan, Missouri, and Ohio. These states have prison rate that are roughly 3x their jail rate! It is also interesting to note that the 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another interesting observation is that northeastern states generally have both low prison and jail rates. We see that 
                Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey are in the bottom left corner of the scatterplot. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, it is very interesting how wide incarceration rates vary by state. For prison rates this ranged from 188 to 964, with 
                Massachusetts on the lower end and Mississippi on the higher end. For jail rates this ranged from 188 to 747, with Minnesota 
                on the lower end and Kentucky on the higher end.

                Total Prison and Jail Population
            </h2>
            <p>
                Next we will take a look at the change of the total prison and jail population from 1983 to 2016. We
                chose this as our year range because it was the only one in which prison data was included. If we
                included all data from 1970, then there would have been a sharp jump at 1983. This is due to the fact
                that only jail data was available from 1970 to 1982. Thus, we limited the data to be more accurately
                representative.
            </p>
            <img src="Incarceration Population.png" width=800px, height=auto>
            <p>
                We can observe that the total incarcerated population increased every year from 1983 to
                2009, except for a small dip in 2000. At its peak, the total population was 1,959,983 in 2009.
                Furthermore, the population has slowly decreased every year from 2010 to 2016, except for a slight jump
                in 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon further inspection, we see that it only took 6 years for the population of incarcerated people to
                more than double from 414,694 in 1983 to 905,074 in 1989. From it's initial number, it takes 12 years
                for the population to more than triple to 1,342,014 in 1995. This suggets a relatively constant growth
                from 1983 to 1995. Fortunately, the growth rate starts to slow down after the year 2000, and as
                previously mentioned, the total incacerated population begins to slowly decrease after 2009.</p>
            <p>The rise in jailing may be linked to the general rise in mass incarceration, especially in prison, that
                began in 1970. According to <a
                    href="https://www.vera.org/ending-mass-incarceration/causes-of-mass-incarceration" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">Vera Justice Institute</a>, to respond to the drug epidemic, the government took a
                law and order paradigm. This included longer, more punitive sentences even for nonviolent crimes.

        <div class="textStyling">
            <p>Upon using the slider bar, we first noticed that the map gradually darkens with time &ndash; Nationally,
                the rate of the population in jail more than doubles in about 30 years, from 0.15%&nbsp; of the
                population in 1983 to a peak at 0.38% in 2006-2009.</p>
            <p>A second noticeable pattern is that the Southern states consistently jail a higher rate of their
                population &ndash; especially the Deep South, and specifically Louisiana. In fact, each year from
                2008-2011, 1% of Louisiana&rsquo;s population was in jail at some point that year. Why does the US south
                tend to jail a higher rate of their population than the rest of the country, and what is going on with
                Louisiana?</p>
            <p>A quick search reveals that Louisiana has been dubbed the &ldquo;incarceration capital of the
                world,&rdquo; partly because many prisoners are serving life sentences without the possibility of
                parole. But why then are its <em>jails</em> also so much more full?</p>
            <p>People are kept jailed for months past their release date, and sometimes state prisoners are kept in
                jails. In fact, a <a
                    href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/louisianas-over-incarceration-is-part-deeply-rooted-pattern-2023-02-01/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOJ report</a> revealed that jails have &ldquo;no financial
                incentive&rdquo; to reduce jail times or to refuse state prisoners because they are paid &ldquo;for each
                day of over detention.&rdquo; Another reason for the over detention, according to <a
                    href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/01/26/louisiana-overdetention-justice-department/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louisiana federal officials</a> themselves, is that Louisiana relies
                on mailed or hand-delivered documents and manual documentation, leading to an outdated, slow inmate
                release system.</p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, in 2017, Louisiana signed criminal justice reforms that have led to declining prison
                populations and recidivism rates, funding reinvested to crime prevention and support &ndash; and instead
                of being number one, it&rsquo;s now number two in the nation for its imprisonment rates. However,
                Louisiana&rsquo;s system is still plagued with problems &ndash; the investigation into its over
                detention practices came out in January 2023.
            </p>
            <p>Since our dataset was missing large portions of <em>prison</em> data, the map above and our analysis only
                includes data for people in <em>jail</em>. However, the prison population can be even larger than the
                jailed population - the Prison Policy Institute <a
                    href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>
                that in 2021, out of 1.9M locked up people, over 1M were in state prisons. This means that some of our
                numbers in the report below are more even startling than they already are. The fact that some states
                jail over 1% of their people has somber implications about their overall incarceration rates.</p>
